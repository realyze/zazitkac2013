      | Ač si všechno pečlivě plánuje do diáře, má ráda dny a situace, kdy je všechno jinak. I přes svou lenost se děsí okamžiku, kdy nebude mít co dělat. A i když není vegetariánka, tak si myslí, že žampiony jsou nejlepší maso. Ráda jezdí metrem a pozoruje ostatní.

      | Petr has been an active volunteer for seven years. He first met INEX-SDA when he went to dig some holes to France. Since then he learned a lot of other useful stuff, such as how to lead a workcamp by himself, how to train other volunteers, communicate with media and do some fundraising. He also founded a Czech microvolunteering platform Um sem um tam. His dream is to do volunteering for living and not to have to go work every day.
