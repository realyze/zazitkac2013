      | Petr has been an active volunteer for seven years. He first met INEX-SDA when he went to dig some holes to France. Since then he learned a lot of other useful stuff, such as how to lead a workcamp by himself, how to train other volunteers, communicate with media and do some fundraising. He also founded a Czech microvolunteering platform Um sem um tam. His dream is to do volunteering for living and not to have to go to work every day.
